  <p>Victims must consume Cheez-its or Goldfish during the hours of 10pm - 3am in the morning for 2 weeks.
  It should be noted that cheap off-brands will not work.</p>
  <p>
  The influx of powdered cheddar cheese at ideal mating hour will give the victim
  more <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em>, resulting in overcrowding.
  <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em> are notoriously unfriendly and cannot get along with each other.
  They will leave the victim's body to avoid living near other <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em>.</p>

    <p>"My daughter's infection with <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em> tore our family apart.
      My husband is British, and he was so offended by her poor imitation of
      his accent that he made her sleep outside on the trampoline.
      Please think of all the people who love you when you're tempted to eat
      cheddar cheese late at night, and just say 'no'.
      This kind of thing shouldn't happen to anyone.</p>
      <p>In the future, I would love to see more people become aware of the dangers
      of <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em>. Right now when I try to explain to my
      friends why my daughter is sleeping outside, they just think I'm joking."</p>
    <p>"It's been really hard."</p>

    <p>"When I saw my doctor and he told me I'd been infected with <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em>,
      I couldn't believe it. I forget where I am and what I'm doing all the time,
      so I just thought that forgetting why I needed to enter a room as soon as
      I got there was completely normal. But then he pointed out to me that
      I'd spent nearly $200 on chocolate milk in the last week, and I thought to myself,
      'yeah, maybe something is wrong with me'. Real bummer of a disease. </p>
      <p>
      On one level, I wish I'd known about <em>Procrasis Quesoaris</em> before I decided
      to eat that block of cheddar cheese while binge-watching Stranger Things.
      On another level though, I think maybe it wouldn't have mattered,
      because I don't really make good decisions no matter what I know. So yeah."
